# MODULE 3: DESIGN PRINCIPLES

## General guidelines of evaluation software solutions

- Evaluate dsign complexity with **coupling** and **cohesion**
    >1. If your design complexity exceeds what developers can mentally handle, then bugs occur more ofen.
    >2. Design complexity applies to both classes and methods within them.

**Coupling** focues on complexity between a module and other modules.
>1. Tight vs loose coupling

The metrics to evaluate coupling of a moudle are
  >1. **Degree**: is the number of connections beween the module and others. The degree should be small for coupling. For example, a module should connect to others through only a few parameters or narraw interfaces.
  - **Ease**: is how obvious are the connections between the module and others. Connection should be easy to make withougt needing to understand the implmentation of other modules, for coupling purpose.
  - **Flexibility**

- the speration of concerns
- information hiding
- conceptual integrity
- generalization principles
