# Inheritance Issues

Generalization and inheritance are some of the more difficult topics to master in object oriented programming.

How do we know if we are abusint iheritance?

>1. Am I using inheritance to simply share attributes or behavior without further adding anything special in my subclasses?

If the answer is yes. there is no point for the subclasses to exist since the superclases already is enough.


>2. You break the liskov substition principle

The principle states taht a subclass can replace a super class if and only if, the subclasses dont change the functionality of the superclasses.


Example

```java
public abstract class Animal {
  private int numberOfLegs;
  private boolean  hasTail;

  public Animal(int legs, boolean tail) {
    this.numberOfLegs = legs;
    this.hasTail = tail;
  }

  public void walk () {}
  public void run () {}
  public void eat() {}

}
```


```java
public abstract class Whale extends Animal {
  public Whale() {
    super(0, true);
  }
  private swim() {}

  private void run() {
    this.swim();
  }
  public void walk() {
    this.swim();
  }
}
```

The subclass is rewriting the run and walk function and replace them with swimining behaviors. The whale no longer behaves in the way we would expect it superclass to behave.

We can use inheritance
>1. The subclass has more functionality than the superclass
>2. Subclass provide and share attributes and behaviors from the same superclass, but each subclass has their own distinct functions.

If an inheritance  does not suit your needs, consider whether decomposition is more appropriate.
