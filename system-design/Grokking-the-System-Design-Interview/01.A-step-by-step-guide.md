# System Design Interviews: A step by step guide


##  Why software engineers struggle with SDIs
- Unstructured nature of SDIs
- Candidate lack experience in developing
- Did not spend enough time for preparation
 

## The steps of System design interviews

-  Requirements clarifications
	- It is always a good idea to ask questions about the exact scope of the problem we are trying to solve
	- Since the inteview time is limited(30~40 minutes), we should clarify what parts of the system we will be focusing on

- Back of the envelope estimation
	- estimate the scale of the sytem we are going to design
		- Help	on scaling
		- partitioning
		- load balancing
		- Caching
   - what scale are we expected from the system
   - how much storage will we need
   - **what network bandwidth usage are expecting**
   
 - System interface definition
	 - Define what APIs are expected from the system
- Define a data model
	Defining the data model in the early part of the interview will clarify **how data will flow between different system components.** Which will influence
	- data partitioning and management
	- How each entity interacts with each other
	- data managements like
		- storage
		- transportation
		- encryption
- High level dsign
 Draw the block diagram to present the core components of our system
- Detailed design
Big deeper into two or three major components, the interviewer's feedback should always guide us to what parts of the system need  further discusssion.
	- **We should present different approches, their pros and cons**, and why
	- The only important thing is to consider tradeoffs between different options why keeping system constraints in mind
   - Terms and question to ask in designing a twetter like system
	   - Hot users who tweet a lot or follow a lots of people
	   - Which layer to import cache
	   - what components need better load balancing

- Identifying and resolving bottomnecks
	Try to discuss as many bottlenecks as possible and different approches to mitigate them
	- For examle
		- Single point of failure
		- Do we have enought replicas of the data 
		- Do we have enough copies
		- How are we monitoring the performance of our services

## Summary

- Preparation and being organized during the interview re the keys to success in system design interviews.
