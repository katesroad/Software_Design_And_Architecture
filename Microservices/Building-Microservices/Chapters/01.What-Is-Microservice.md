# What are Microservices


## Historical stories

 - **Tech Goals**: To make the customers and the developers to be happier.
- **Domain Driven Design** : understand the importance of representing the real world in our code, and show us a better way to model system.
- **Continuously delivery**

## What are microservices

**What are microservices**
- Small and focused on doing one thing well (single responsibility)
	- cohesion is required in microservices too
	(We focus on our service boundaries  on business boundaries)
- Autonomous
	- try to avoid packing multiple services onto the same machine
		- All communication between services are via network calls, to enforce separation between the services and avoid the perils of tight coupling
		- Services need to be able to change independently of each other, be deployed by themselves without requiring customers to change
      - expose API

## Key benefits

Distributed systems and service-oriented architecture

- Tech heterogeneity
	- We can decide to use different technologies inside of each one
- Resilience
	- Other services are resilience to one service's failure
	- The new source of failure that distributed systems have to deal with
- Scaling
	- microservices' way: Each service can be scaled horizontally
	- Monolithic way: we have to scale everything together
When embracing on-demand provisioning systems like those provided by AWS, we can even apply scaling on demand of those pieces that need it. --> Control cost more effectively.
- Ease of deployment
- Organizational alignment
	- Small teams working on smaller codebases tend to be more productive(**management issue**)
- Composability
	- Open up to opportunities for reuse of functionalities
- Optimizing for Replaceability
## What about service oriented architecture

- **SOA** is a design approach where multiple services  collaborate to provide some end set of capabilities. A service here  typically means a completely separate operating system process. -
- **Communication between these services occurs via calls across network rather than method calls within a process boundary**.

## Decomositional techs
	
- Shared libraries
	- Drawbacks
		- You can't deploy a new library without deploying the entire process
		- Lost tech heterogeneity
		- ease with which you can scale parts of you system independently from each other is curtailed.
- Service oriented architecture && microservices 
- Modules

**-> no silver bullet**
