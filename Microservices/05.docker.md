# Docker

Docker and microservices are nearly synonymous.

##  Docker Introduction

- facilitate software installlation. `Dockerfile`, which describe the installation of the software in a simple way.


## Docker for Microservices


### OS processes for microservices

- **Microservices must at least be separate processes** to avoid endangering the endanger the robustness of the whole system. 
- The microservices should run in a cluster. Kubernetes and Cloud Foundry support running microservices in a cluster.

With processes, robustness is guaranteed to a certain extent because the crash of one process does not affect the other processes.

## Docker Basics

- Docker represents a lightweight alternative to virtualization.
- Docker containers share the [kernel](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(computer_science)) of the operating system on the Docker host
- **Isolated network of Dockers**

The Docker containers have their own network interface. In this way, **the same port can be used in each Docker container**. Yet, **ports of a Docker container can be mapped to ports on the Docker host**.

## File system

- There are layers in the file system. When a microservice reads a file, it goes through the layers from top to bottom until it finds the data. The containers can share layers.

- Therefore, only one process should run in a Docker container.
