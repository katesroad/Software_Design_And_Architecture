# Facade Pattern

**Tutorial**: https://www.coursera.org/learn/design-patterns/lecture/prQp9/2-1-5-facade-pattern


**What problem does facade pattern solve**

- The client class provide a simpler interface to interact with subsystem.

- A facade simply acts as a point of entry into your subsystem.

- A facade is a wrapper  class that encapulates a subsystem in order to hde the subsystem's complexity.


**Example**:

The banksystem, before and after using facade pattern. This example combines one 

**when**

- You need to simplify the interaction with your system for client classes
- You need a class to act as an interface beween your subsytem and a client class

**How**

Ofen facade design patterns combine interface implmentation by one or more classes, which then gets wrapped by the facade class. This can be explained through a number of steps (lecture p.19)

- Design the interface
- Implement the interface with one or more classes
- Create the facade class and wrap the classes that implement the interface
- Use the facade class to access the subsystem

Sample code please refer to lecture p.21.


**Summary**

- Is a means to hide the complexity of a subsystem by encapsulating it behinde a unifying wrapper called a facade class.
- Remove all the need for client classes to manage  a subsytem on their own, resulting in less coupling between the subsystem and the client classes.
- Handles instantiation and rediction of tasks to the appropriate class within the system.
- Provides client classes with a simplified interface for the subsystem.
- Acts simply as a point of entry to a system and does not add more functional to the substem.
