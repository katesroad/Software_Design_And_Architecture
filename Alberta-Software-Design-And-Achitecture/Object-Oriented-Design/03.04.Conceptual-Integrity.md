# Concetual integrity

Goal: create more consistent code.

- Naming convention example

>1. calcStudentGPA
>2. getStudentCourses
>3. getStudentDegree

- Code review
- Unifying concepts to avoid special cases
- Having a core group that accepts the code commits to the code base.


Keeping things consitent and logical would make it much easier to maintain and work with.
