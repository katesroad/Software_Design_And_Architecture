# Language Based Systems

In previous courses, the following object-oriented principles were
explored:
>1.  **Abstraction** that simplifies a concept
>2.  **Encapsulation** that bundles data and functions into a selfcontained object, so other objects can interact with it
through an exposed interface
>3.  **Decomposition** that breaks a whole into parts
>4. **Generalization** that allows you to factor out conceptual
commonalities

Object-oriented design patterns were also explored. These can fall
into the following categories:
>1. **Creational patterns** that guide the creation of new objects
>2. **Structural patterns **that describe the relationships between
objects and the interactions between classes and subclasses
>3. **Behavioural patterns** that focus on how objects perform
work individually or as a group to accomplish something


## Abstract Data Types and Object Oriented Design

**Object oriented design architecture styles are focuses on the data.**

Object-oriented refers to a system composed of objects where each
object is an instance of a class.

**These classes themselves form a language-based architecture that
arises from basic object-oriented principles. The classes within the system will determine the overall structure of the system.**
