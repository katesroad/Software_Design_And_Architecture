# Activity Diagram

A **UML activity diagram** allows the representation of the **control flow** from activity to another in a software system. It captures the dynamic behaviour of the system and allows the mapping of branching into alternative flows.

>1. Identify the activities
>2. Identity the respective conditions of the system's activities


There are a few major parts to an activity diagram
>1. Start nodes 
>2. End nodes
>3. Intermidiate activities
>4. Decision nodes
