# Kruchten's 4+1 Model View


Multiple perspective are nessary to capture the complete behaviour and development of a software system. There are five considerations

- The functionality of the software
>1. Focusing on functionality and the needed objects leads to a perspective of **logic view**
- How well the software executes
>1. Focusing on the processes implemented by the objects in the logical view leads to a perspective leads to **process view.**
- This perspective focuses on implementation considerations
>1. **development view**
- The software will have physical components that interact and need to be deployed
>1. Physical view

- The **Scenarios**
>1. **outline use cases or tasks required by the end users, which provides context to help to detail the four views.**

The four view and one seneriao form the **Kruchtenâ€™s 4+1 View Model.**

## Logic View

>1. Focuses on the functional requirements of a system, usuall invovles the objects of the system.
>2. A UML class diagram can be created to illurstrate the logical view

## Phsyical View

Map software elements to hardware for runing the system

## Senerios
Senerios align with the use cases and task of a system and show how the four other views work togther.
