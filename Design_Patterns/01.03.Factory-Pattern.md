# Factory Pattern

## Factory Objects

A factory object operates like a factory in the real world, and creates objects. The methods that use these factories can focus on other behaviour.

## Benifits of Factory Objects

Factories allow client to operate on generalization. This is known as **coding to an instance, not an implementation**.


## Factory Method Pattern

Generally, in order to create a “specialized” product object, a Factory Object approach would subclass the factory class. For example, a subclass of the Knife Factory called BudgetKnifeFactory would make BudgetChefsKnife and BudgetSteakKnife product objects.


Let the subclass decide how objects are made.

```java
public abstract class KnifeStore {
  public Knife orderKnife(String knifeType) {
  Knife knife;
  // now creating a knife is a method in the
  class knife = createKnife(knifeType);
    knife.sharpen();
    knife.polish();
    knife.package();
    return knife;
  }
  abstract Knife createKnife(String type);
}
```

Subclass which defines the knife type

```java
public BudgetKnifeStore extends KnifeStore {
//up to any subclass of KnifeStore to define this method
Knife createKnife(String knifeTYpe) {
  if (knifeType.equals(“steak”)) {
    return new BudgetSteakKnife();
  } else if (knifeType.equals(“chefs”)) {
    return new BudgetChefsKnife();
  }
  else return null;
  }
}
```
